# COVID-19 Data Analysis

This project explores global COVID-19 data to extract insights and visualize trends using Python. The analysis focuses on identifying patterns in cases, deaths, and recovery rates across different countries and over time.

## 📊 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess COVID-19 datasets
- Analyze daily trends and cumulative counts
- Compare country-level statistics
- Visualize key insights using plots and charts

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Notebook for COVID data.ipynb`: Main analysis and visualizations
- `covid19_dataset.csv`: Sample dataset used for the project

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Growth trend of COVID-19 cases and deaths globally
- Top 10 countries with the highest impact
- Comparative recovery and fatality rates
- Rolling averages for case smoothing

## 📎 How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) in your environment.
3. Ensure required libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.) are installed.
4. Run cells to see analysis and visualizations.
